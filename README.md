# Anime Web Manager
Constatly scraps the web for new episodes (animes), and notifies the user about new episodes, with a built-in interface using Tkinter.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them
### NOTE: Haven't tested this software on Linux or Mac.

```
pip install pillow
install pyler module from https://github.com/kivy/plyer , since pip install pyler has problems atleast for me
and then unzip it and run in the folder console python setup.py install 
```

## Features to add (from Priority):

- Notifications; ✔ (locate on bottom right of the screen, and add priority over some programs)
- Anime banner instead of a button; ✔
- Wishlist; ✔ (TODO: add interface for the user to add)
- Anime browsing with search functionality;
- Get data from diffrent websites, not only www.9anime.to;
- Organize better the code; (WIP)
